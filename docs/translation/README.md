# Translation Guide

This project uses **[i18next](https://www.i18next.com/)** with **React Native** for internationalization.  
We welcome contributions to add or improve translations!

## Adding a new language

1. Copy the base English translation files and rename them to your locale code (see the list above):

   - `assets/i18n/core/en.json` → `assets/i18n/core/<locale>.json`  
   - `assets/i18n/loading/en.json` → `assets/i18n/loading/<locale>.json`

2. Translate all keys into your language.

3. Commit your changes using a proper prefix:

   - `feat: add <locale> translation` (for new translations)  
   - `fix: update <locale> translation` (for improvements/fixes)

4. Open a Pull Request.

## ArkhamDB syntax support

Many texts in the app support the **formatting syntax used by ArkhamDB card texts**.  
If the English translation contains this syntax, you can (and should) use it in your translation as well.

### Examples

- `[resource]` → displays an icon with ID **resource**  
- `[[Discipline]]` → formats a keyword (usually **bold italic**)  
- `<b>Bold</b>` → bold text  
- `\n` → line break  

Additional syntax:

- `<old>Old Value</old>` → marks an old value (usually displayed semi-transparent)

## Loading screen phrases

From time to time, the app needs a moment to load data.  
To keep this screen fun, short phrases from the game universe appear under the loading indicator.

All phrases are stored here:

```
assets/i18n/loading/en.json
```


Use the English file as a guide.  
You don’t have to translate every phrase word for word — it’s perfectly fine to adapt them for your community.  
Local jokes or cultural references are welcome, as long as they fit the style of the game.  

⚠️ Just make sure your phrases stay friendly:  
avoid anything offensive or disrespectful.

### Adding a new language for loading phrases

After you create your `assets/i18n/loading/<locale>.json` file, you also need to register it in:

```
assets/i18n/loading/index.ts
```

Then add your new locale. For example, if you are adding German (`de`):

```ts
import de from "./de.json"; // import locale file

export const loadingTranslations: Record<string, string[]> = {
  en,
  ru,
  de, // <-- here
};

```

## Plurals

Some languages use different word forms depending on the number (pluralization).  
The app relies on [i18next plural rules](https://www.i18next.com/translation-function/plurals).  

- Please make sure you provide **all plural forms** required for your language.  
- Detailed instructions and examples for every supported locale can be found here:
