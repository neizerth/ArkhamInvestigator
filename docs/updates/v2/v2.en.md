# Updates in v2.0.0

## Simultaneous actions are grouped into a single history entry

Rolling back a history entry now reverts all related changes.

For example:

1. Clicking on 0 actions changes the number to 3 and updates used abilities
2. Some investigator abilities, like Calvin’s, when a change in health or sanity results in stat changes

## Redesigned notifications

Now notifications don’t interfere with changing values on the board and are displayed at the top.

Personal notifications are displayed with an image.

## Personal abilities

Support for reactions, fast actions, and Elder Signs for more than 30 investigators. A full list of supported abilities can be found [here](../../features/investigators/investigators.ru.md).

## Token modification

You can now modify the values of any tokens, including:

1. Curse and Bless tokens
2. Numerical tokens (for example, for the card *Sure Gamble*). The value changes only for the draw and only for that token (permanent changes to numbers don’t seem necessary for now).

When a token’s value is modified, this number is also substituted into the effect text where possible (replacing X or the old number in the text).

## Auto-Success and Auto-Fail

Some scenarios have Cultist or Elder Thing tokens that allow you to choose auto-fail or auto-success.

1. This option can now be scrolled to on the token dial at the moment of the draw, if available
2. The test result now also scrolls and consists of two parts: the test value and auto-success or auto-fail, depending on the outcome. This information is logged in the token draw history
3. The app supports all Elder Signs with auto-success or auto-fail

## Cancel/Ignore and Cancel Token Effects

On the token draw screen, a 3-mode toggle is available:

1. Inactive
2. Cancel token – its modifier does **not** apply to the test result, and its effect is canceled (note appears in the text)
3. Cancel effect – the modifier applies to the test, but the effect is canceled

## Exiting test mode

You can now minimize the test window to check stats or do something else, and then return to the test afterwards.

## Offline mode

After the first successful app load, you can use the board without internet access: all images and data will be stored on the device.

## Performance optimization

To prevent slowdowns, the app crops the source image so that it fills the screen and centers the investigator’s face in the visible area. This procedure takes time, so while you wait, you may see 1–3 memorable quotes from the game.

## Edge to Edge

This will be the default in Android 16: the background of the system buttons (the 3 at the bottom) is now transparent, requiring developer attention to ensure proper display.

It doesn’t add any useful features, but without it, Android 16 users might face issues such as the background blending with light images.

## Dynamic navigation menu color

For light images, the status bar icons (time, battery, etc.) are dark. For dark images, they switch to light.

## Sound feedback for changes

You can enable sound feedback when scrolling values. It’s somewhat similar to the sound of a magnetic counter on wooden boards. Even better, every counter change also triggers haptic feedback.
