# Updates in v2.0.0

## Grouped simultaneous actions in history

When rolling back a history entry, all related changes are reverted together.

For example:

1. Clicking on 0 actions changes the number to 3 and updates used abilities.
2. Some investigators’ abilities (like Calvin’s) update stats when health or sanity changes.

## Redesigned notifications

Notifications no longer block controls on the tablet and are now displayed at the top.

Personal notifications include the investigator’s portrait.

## Investigator abilities

Support for reactions, fast actions, and Elder Sign effects for more than 30 investigators.
The full list of supported abilities can be found [here](../../features/investigators/investigators.en.md).

## Token modification

You can now modify the values of any tokens, including:

1. Curses and Blesses.
2. Numeric tokens (e.g., for the “Sure Gamble” card).
   The value only changes during the draw and only for that specific token (permanent numeric changes are not yet needed).

When a token value is changed, that number is also substituted in the effect text, if possible (replacing X or the old numeric value).

## Auto-success and auto-fail

Some scenarios include auto-success or auto-fail on cultist or elder thing tokens.

1. These can now be scrolled to on the token dial during the draw, if available.
2. The skill test result now consists of 2 values: the test result and auto-success or auto-fail, depending on the check. This information is recorded in the token draw history.
3. The app supports all Elder Signs that include auto-success or auto-fail.

## Cancel/ignore and cancel token effects

The token draw screen now has a 3-way toggle:

1. Inactive.
2. Cancel the token — its modifier does NOT affect the test result, and the effect is cancelled (a note appears in the text).
3. Cancel the effect — the modifier applies, but the effect is cancelled.

## Exiting skill test mode

You can now minimize the skill test window, check stats or do something else, and then return to the test.

## Offline mode

After the first successful app load, the tablet can be used offline: all images and data are stored on the device.

## Performance optimizations

### Images

To avoid slowdowns, the source image is cropped to fill the screen while keeping the investigator’s face centered.
This takes some processing time, so while waiting, you’ll see flavorful quotes from the game.

### Interface

For smoother performance on older or budget Android devices, you can:

1. Disable page transition animations.
2. Disable counter scrolling animations.

## Edge to Edge

This is the default in Android 16: the background of the three system buttons at the bottom is now transparent, requiring extra care from developers to ensure correct display.

It doesn’t add useful features, but without it Android 16 users may face issues like the background blending into a light photo.

## Dynamic navigation bar color

For light images, status bar elements (time, battery, icons) are dark. For dark images, they switch to light.

## Sound feedback for changes

You can now enable sound when scrolling values — similar to the click of a magnetic counter on wooden trackers.
Combined with vibration feedback, it makes counter changes more tactile and satisfying.

Хочешь, я ещё отшлифую формулировки так, чтобы они выглядели как официальные patch notes (короче, сухо и в стиле release notes), или оставить в более «живом» описательном ключе?
